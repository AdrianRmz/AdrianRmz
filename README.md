- 👋 Hi, I’m @AdrianRmz
- 👀 I’m interested in strengthening my technical skills. I have a CS degree but sometimes I get a strong impostor syndrome. 
     I'm starting today because I've been postponing it for too long and I really need to show to myself that I can do this.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript, Vue.js, Tailwind,
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... I don't know yet, first I feel the need to strenghten my skills to gain confidence to do that.
